# The request handler is the layer which connects Apache with the underlying application's
# request dispatcher (i.e. either Rails's Dispatcher class or Rack).
# The request handler's job is to process incoming HTTP requests using the
# currently loaded Ruby on Rails application. HTTP requests are forwarded
# to the request handler by the web server. HTTP responses generated by the
# RoR application are forwarded to the web server, which, in turn, sends the
# response back to the HTTP client.
#
# AbstractRequestHandler is an abstract base class for easing the implementation
# of request handlers for Rails and Rack.
#
# == Design decisions
#
# Some design decisions are made because we want to decrease system
# administrator maintenance overhead. These decisions are documented
# in this section.
#
# === Abstract namespace Unix sockets
#
# AbstractRequestHandler listens on a Unix socket for incoming requests. If possible,
# AbstractRequestHandler will try to create a Unix socket on the _abstract namespace_,
# instead of on the filesystem. If the RoR application crashes (segfault),
# or if it gets killed by SIGKILL, or if the system loses power, then there
# will be no stale socket files left on the filesystem.
# Unfortunately, abstract namespace Unix sockets are only supported by Linux.
# On systems that do not support abstract namespace Unix sockets,
# AbstractRequestHandler will automatically fallback to using regular Unix socket files.
#
# It is possible to force AbstractRequestHandler to use regular Unix socket files by
# setting the environment variable PASSENGER_NO_ABSTRACT_NAMESPACE_SOCKETS
# to 1.
#
# === Owner pipes
#
# Because only the web server communicates directly with a request handler,
# we want the request handler to exit if the web server has also exited.
# This is implemented by using a so-called _owner pipe_. The writable part
# of the pipe will be passed to the web server* via a Unix socket, and the web
# server will own that part of the pipe, while AbstractRequestHandler owns
# the readable part of the pipe. AbstractRequestHandler will continuously
# check whether the other side of the pipe has been closed. If so, then it
# knows that the web server has exited, and so the request handler will exit
# as well. This works even if the web server gets killed by SIGKILL.
#
# * It might also be passed to the ApplicationPoolServerExecutable, if the web
#   server's using ApplicationPoolServer instead of StandardApplicationPool.
#
#
# == Request format
#
# Incoming "HTTP requests" are not true HTTP requests, i.e. their binary
# representation do not conform to RFC 2616. Instead, the request format
# is based on CGI, and is similar to that of SCGI.
#
# The format consists of 3 parts:
# - A 32-bit big-endian integer, containing the size of the transformed
#   headers.
# - The transformed HTTP headers.
# - The verbatim (untransformed) HTTP request body.
#
# HTTP headers are transformed to a format that satisfies the following
# grammar:
#
#  headers ::= header*
#  header ::= name NUL value NUL
#  name ::= notnull+
#  value ::= notnull+
#  notnull ::= "\x01" | "\x02" | "\x02" | ... | "\xFF"
#  NUL = "\x00"
#
# The web server transforms the HTTP request to the aforementioned format,
# and sends it to the request handler.

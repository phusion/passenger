    # Please note that even if the CPU supports multiple architectures, the
    # operating system might not. For example most x86 CPUs nowadays also
    # support x86_64, but x86_64 Linux systems require various x86 compatibility
    # libraries to be installed before x86 executables can be run. This function
    # does not detect whether these compatibility libraries are installed.
    # The only guarantee that you have is that the OS can run executables in
    # the architecture denoted by the first item in the result.
    #
    # For example, on x86_64 Linux this function can return ["x86_64", "x86"].
    # This indicates that the CPU supports both of these architectures, and that
    # the OS's main/preferred architecture is x86_64. Most executables on the
    # system are thus be x86_64. It is guaranteed that the OS can run x86_64
    # executables, but not x86 executables per se.

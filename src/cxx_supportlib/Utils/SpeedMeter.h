/**
 * Utility class which, when periodically fed with quantities, measures the
 * rate of change in the most recent time period. It does this by storing
 * samples of the most recent quantities, calculating a weighted average of
 * the differences between each sample, and extrapolating that over a time
 * period.
 *
 * For example,
 *
 *  * When periodically given the number of miles a car has driven so far,
 *    the average speed of the most recent 10 minutes can be calculated.
 *  * When periodically given the number of processes the OS has created
 *    so far, the average fork rate (per minute) of the most recent minute
 *    can be calculated.
 *
 * SpeedMeter is designed to use as little memory as possible, and designed
 * so that samples can be taken at erratic intervals. This is why it limits
 * the number of samples that can be stored in memory, and why it puts time
 * limits on the samples.
 *
 *
 * ## Template parameters
 *
 * ### `maxSamples`
 *
 * `maxSamples` dictates the sample buffer size: the maximum number of samples
 * to hold in memory. Defaults to 8.
 *
 * The more samples you have, the more historical data influences the results.
 * If you have few samples then recent data have the most impact on the results.
 *
 * ### `minAge`
 *
 * A new sample is only accepted if at least `minAge` microseconds
 * have passed since the last sample. This is to ensure that the sample
 * buffer contains enough historical data so that results are not skewed by
 * adding samples too quickly. A full sample buffer is guaranteed to cover
 * the last `minAge * maxSamples` microseconds.
 *
 * Defaults to 1 second (1 000 000 usec).
 *
 * To see why this is useful, consider when `maxSamples` is 5 and `minAge` is 0.
 * If you measure the number of processes 5 times with 10 ms in between,
 * then it's unlikely that the OS has spawned any processes in that 50 ms time
 * interval. However you've now filled the sample buffer with only data from
 * those 5 recent measurements, so SpeedMeter thinks the rate of change is 0.
 * If you set `minAge` to, say, 5 seconds, then the sample buffer will be updated
 * at most once every 5 seconds, guaranteeing that it can retain historical data
 * for the last 25 seconds.
 *
 * `minAge * maxSamples` should be larger than `window`.
 *
 * ### `maxAge`
 *
 * When calculating the result, samples older than `maxAge` usec ago are ignored.
 * This value should be larger than `window`. Defaults to 1 minute (60 000 000
 * usec).
 *
 * ### `window`
 *
 * When calculating the result, this value dictates the time interval over which
 * the rate of change should be calculated. Defaults to 1 second (1 000 000 usec),
 * meaning that by default the result describes the speed per second.
 *
 *
 * ## Interpreting the parameters
 *
 * Given parameters, the behavior of SpeedMeter can be interpreted as follows:
 *
 * All samples that have been collected in the last `minAge * maxSamples` usecs
 * (or the last `maxAge` usecs, if samples have been collected slowly), are used for
 * calculating the speed per `window` usecs.
 *
 * Thus, given the default parameter values, we can say:
 *
 * All samples that have been collected in the last 8 seconds (the last 1 minute,
 * if samples have been collected slowly), are used for calculating the speed
 * per second.

<banner>Deploying a web application: an example</banner>

Suppose you have a web application in <b>/somewhere</b>. Add a <b>server</b> block
to your Nginx configuration file, set its <b>root</b> to <b>/somewhere/public</b>, and set
<b>'passenger_enabled on'</b>, like this:
<b>
   server {
      listen 80;
      server_name www.yourhost.com;
      root /somewhere/public;   # <--- be sure to point to 'public'!
      passenger_enabled on;
   }
</b>
And that's it! You may also want to check the Users Guide for security and

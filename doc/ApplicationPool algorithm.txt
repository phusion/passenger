= ApplicationPool algorithm


== Introduction

For efficiency reasons, Passenger keeps a pool spawned Rails/Ruby applications.
Please read the C++ API documentation for the ApplicationPool class for a full
introduction. This document describes an algorithm for managing the pool.

The algorithm should strive to keep spawning to a minimum.

TODO: check whether the algorithm has thrashing behavior.


== Definitions

=== Vocabulary

- "Application root":
  The toplevel directory in which an application is contained. For Rails
  application, this is the same as RAILS_ROOT, i.e. the directory that contains
  "app/", "public/", etc. For a Rack application, this is the directory that
  contains "config.ru".

- "Active application instance":
  An application instance that has more than 0 active sessions.

=== Types

Most of the types that we use in this document are pretty standard. But we
explicitly define some special types:

- list<SomeType>
  A doubly linked list which contains elements of type SomeType. It supports
  all the usual list operations that one can expect from a linked list, like
  add_to_back(), etc.
  
  The following operations deserve special mention:
  * remove(iterator)
    Removes the specified element from the list. _iterator_ is a linked list
    iterator: it probably contains the links and a reference to the actual
    list element, depending on the list implementation. This operation can be
    done in O(1) time.
  
  * move_to_front(iterator)
    Moves the specified element to the front of the list. _iterator_ is an
    iterator, as described earlier.
  
- Domain
  A compound type (class) which contains information about an application root,
  such as the application instances that have been spawned for this application
  root.
  
  A Domain has the following members:
  * instances (list<AppContainer>) - a list of AppContainer objects.
    
    Invariant:
        containers is non-empty.
        for all 0 <= i < containers.size() - 1:
           if containers[i].app is active:
              containers[i + 1].app is active

  * size (unsigned integer): The number of items in _instances_.

- AppContainer
  A compound type (class) which contains an application instance, as well as
  iterators for various linked lists. These iterators make it possible to
  perform actions on the linked list in O(1) time.
  
  An AppContainer has the following members:
  * app - An Application object, representing an application instance.
  * last_used (time) - The last time a session for this application instance
    was opened or closed.
  * sessions (integer) - The number of open sessions for this application
    instance.
    Invariant:
       (sessions == 0) == (This AppContainer is in inactive_apps.)
  * iterator - The iterator for this AppContainer in the linked list
    domains[app.app_root].instances
  * ia_iterator - The iterator for this AppContainer in the linked list
    inactive_apps. This iterator is only valid if this AppContainer really is
    in that list.

=== Special functions

- spawn(app_root)
  Spawns a new instance of the application at the given application root.
  Throws an exception if something went wrong. This function is thread-safe.
  Note that application initialization can take an arbitrary amount of time.

=== Instance variables

The algorithm requires the following instance variables for storing state
information:

- lock: mutex
  This lock is used for implementing thread-safetiness. We assume that it
  is non-recursive, i.e. if a thread locks a mutex that it has already locked,
  then it will result in a deadlock.

- domains: map[string => Domain]
  Maps an application root to its Domain object. This map contains all
  application instances in the pool.
  
  Invariant:
     for all values d in domains:
        d.size <= count
     (sum of all d.size in domains) == count
  
- max: integer
  The maximum number of AppContainer objects that may exist in the pool.

- max_per_app: integer
  The maximum number of AppContainer objects that may be simultaneously alive
  for a single Domain.

- count: integer
  The current number of AppContainer objects in the pool.
  Since 'max' can be set dynamically during the life time of an application
  pool, 'count > max' is possible.

- active: integer
  The number of application instances in the pool that are active.
  Invariant:
     active <= count

- inactive_apps: list<AppContainer>
  A linked list of AppContainer objects. All application instances in this list
  are inactive.
  
  Invariant:
     inactive_apps.size() == count - active
     for all c in inactive_apps:
        c can be found in _domains_.
        c.sessions == 0

- restart_file_times: map[string => time]
  Maps an application root to the last known modification time of
  'restart.txt'.
  
  Invariant:
     for all keys app_root in restart_times:
        domains.has_key(app_root)


== Class relations

Here's an UML diagram in ASCII art:

[AppContainer] 1..* -------+
                           |
                           |
                           
                           1
[ApplicationPool]       [Domain]

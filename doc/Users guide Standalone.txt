= Phusion Passenger Standalone users guide

image:images/phusion_banner.png[link="http://www.phusion.nl/"]

link:https://www.phusionpassenger.com/[Phusion Passenger] is a web server and application server, designed to be fast, robust and lightweight. It runs your web apps with the least amount of hassle by taking care of almost all administrative heavy lifting for you. Advanced administration tools allow you to gain deep insight into your web applications' operations and to keep your servers healthy. Phusion Passenger is polyglot by design, and currently supports Ruby (Rack), Python (WSGI) and Node.js.

In the Standalone mode, Phusion Passenger operates as a fully-featured, secure standalone HTTP server. You do not need to have an existing web server like Apache or Nginx. This mode is ideal...

 * ...if you are not familiar with Apache or Nginx
 * ...when you want to quickly start up a server without editing configuration files (e.g. during development)
 * ...or when you want to decouple the web server from the application server, by setting up reverse proxies.

== Usage

Go to your application's root directory, and run:

------------------------------
passenger start
------------------------------

== Configuration

=== Command line options

Most configuration is done by customizing the arguments passed to the `passenger` command. The most important ones are:

`--port NUMBER`::
	The port number that Phusion Passenger should listen on. Defaults to 3000.
`--environment NAME`::
	Customizes the value of the `RAILS_ENV`, `RACK_ENV` and `PASSENGER_ENV` environment variable. The default is "development".
`--max-pool-size NUMBER`::
	The maximum number of application processes to run. The maximum number that you can run depends on the amount of memory your server has. The article link:http://blog.phusion.nl/2013/03/12/tuning-phusion-passengers-concurrency-settings/[Tuning Phusion Passenger's concurrency settings] explains how you can infer a good number for this option.
`--min-instances NUMBER`::
	If you don't want the number of application processes to scale dynamically, then use this option to set it to a value equal to `--max-pool-size`.
`--spawn-method NAME`::
	When set to "smart" (the default), Phusion Passenger preloads your app and utilizes copy-on-write in order to save memory. You can disable this by setting this option to "direct". Preloading is only supported for Ruby apps. For apps written in other languages, it is as if "direct" is always used.
`--no-friendly-error-pages`::
	If your app fails to start, Phusion Passenger will tell you by showing a friendly error page in the browser. This option disables it.
`--ssl`::
	Enables SSL support. If this is set, you must also set `--ssl-certificate` and `--ssl-certificate-key` to the SSL certificate and key files, respectively.

See `--help` for all available options.


[[config_file]]
=== Configuration file
:version: 4.0.24
include::users_guide_snippets/since_version.txt[]

It is possible to store some options in a configuration file `passenger-standalone.json` in the application directory. Configuration in this file overrides command line options. The configuration file format is JSON.

In case Passenger Standalone is in <<mass_deployment,mass deployment mode>>, such a configuration file allows customizing options on a per-application basis.

The following configuration options are supported:

`port`::
	Equivalent to the `--port` command line option.
`environment`::
	Equivalent to the `--environment` command line option.
`max_pool_size`::
	Equivalent to the `--max-pool-size` command line option. But when in mass deployment mode, this option in the configuration file has no effect; the command line option should be used to customize this.
`min_instances`::
	Equivalent to the `--min-instances` command line option.
`spawn_method`::
	Equivalent to the `--spawn-method` command line option.
`ssl`::
	Equivalent to the `--ssl` command line option. When given, you must also set `ssl_certificate` and `ssl_certificate_key` in the configuration file.
+
When in mass deployment mode, you will probably want to set a different `port` too. If you don't, and you end up in a situation in which a port is used for both HTTP and HTTPS traffic, then the builtin Nginx core will abort with an error.

Here is an example configuration file:

[source,javascript]
------------------
{
	"port": 8000,
	"environment": "production",
	"ssl": true,
	"ssl_certificate": "/path-to-cert.crt",
	"ssl_certificate_key": "/path-to-cert.key"
}
------------------


=== Advanced configuration

Phusion Passenger Standalone is built on the same technology that powers link:Users%20guide%20Nginx.html[Phusion Passenger for Nginx], so any configuration option supported by Phusion Passenger for Nginx can be applied to Standalone as well. You can do this by editing the Standalone configuration template directly.

First, go to the directory where Phusion Passenger is installed:

-------------------------------------
cd $(passenger-config --root)
-------------------------------------

Then open the file `resources/templates/standalone/config.erb`.

NOTE: If you installed Phusion Passenger using the Debian or Ubuntu packages, then the filename is `/usr/share/passenger/templates/standalone/config.erb` or `/usr/share/passenger-enterprise/templates/standalone/config.erb`.

Please note that changes to this file only last until you reinstall or upgrade Phusion Passenger. We are currently working on a mechanism for permanently editing the configuration file.


== Using Passenger Standalone in production

[[starting_at_system_boot]]
=== Starting Passenger Standalone at system boot

The easiest way to have Passenger Standalone started during system boot is add it to the file `/etc/rc.local`. This script is called during system boot.

Here's an example of what you may want to add to `/etc/rc.local`. If there is an `exit` command in `rc.local`, make sure you add these _before_ the `exit` command.

[source,sh]
------------------------------------------
# If you installed Phusion Passenger from tarball, add its `bin` directory to PATH.
#export PATH=/path-to-passenger/bin:$PATH

# Change working directory to your webapp.
cd /path-to-your-webapp

# Start Passenger Standalone in daemonized mode. Passenger will be started as
# root when run from this file, so we also tell it to drop its privileges to a
# normal user. Replace 'someusername' with the user you want to run your
# application under.
passenger start --daemonize --port 80 --user someusername
------------------------------------------


[[mass_deployment]]
== Mass deployment
:version: 3.0.0
include::users_guide_snippets/enterprise_only.txt[]

Mass deployment is a special mode in Phusion Passenger Standalone that allows you to deploy multiple web applications without having to create configuration entries for each one of them. Given a directory with multiple web applications, Passenger Standalone will automatically give each web application its own virtual host entry, and serve all of them from a single server. The virtual host's server name is equal to the web application's directory name. Whenever a new web application is added or removed, Passenger Standalone automatically reconfigures itself without administrator intervention. This makes the mass deployment mode especially useful when there are a large number of web applications.

For example, suppose we have a directory `/webapps` with three web applications: Ruby app, a Python app and a Node.js app.

----------------------------
/webapps
  |
  +-- rubyapp.com
  |    |
  |    +-- config.ru
  |
  +-- pythonapp.com
  |    |
  |    +-- passenger_wsgi.py
  |
  +-- nodeapp.com
       |
       +-- app.js
----------------------------

You can activate Passenger Standalone in mass deployment mode by changing the working directory to `/webapps` and running `passenger start`:

----------------------------
$ cd /webapps
$ passenger start
=============== Phusion Passenger Standalone web server started ===============
PID file: /webapps/passenger.3000.pid
Log file: /webapps/passenger.3000.log
Environment: development

Serving these applications on 0.0.0.0 port 3000:
 Host name                     Directory
.-----------------------------------------------------------
 rubyapp.com                   /webapps/rubyapp.com
 pythonapp.com                 /webapps/pythonapp.com
 nodeapp.com                   /webapps/nodeapp.com
.-----------------------------------------------------------
----------------------------

If you for example remove `/webapps/rubyapp.com`, Passenger Standalone will reconfigure itself without that web application. Or if you add a new web applications `/webapps/newapp.org`, Passenger Standalone will reconfigure itself with that web application.

Any options that you pass to the `passenger` command will affect all deployed web applications. It is also possible to change options on a per-application basis through the use of <<config_file,a `passenger-standalone.json` file inside each application's directory>>.

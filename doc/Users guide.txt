Phusion Passenger is an Apache module, which makes deploying Ruby and Ruby on
Rails applications on Apache a breeze. It follows the usual Ruby on Rails
conventions, such as "Don't-Repeat-Yourself" and ease of setup, while at the
same time providing enough flexibility.

This users guide will teach you:

- How to install Phusion Passenger.
- How to configure Phusion Passenger.
- How to deploy a Ruby on Rails application.
- How to deploy a link:http://rack.rubyforge.org/[Rack]-based Ruby application.
- How to solve common problems.

This guide assumes that the reader is somewhat familiar with Apache and with
using the commandline.


== Supported operating systems ==

Phusion Passenger works on any POSIX-compliant operating system. In other
words: practically any operating system on earth, except Microsoft Windows.

Phusion Passenger has been tested on:

- Ubuntu Linux 6.06 (x86)
- Ubuntu Linux 7.10 (x86)
- Debian Sarge (x86)
- Debian Etch (x86)
- Debian Lenny/Sid (x86)
- CentOS 5 (x86)
- Red Hat Enterprise Linux 5 (x86)
- Gentoo, March 14 2008 (AMD64)
- FreeBSD 6.1-RELEASE (x86)
- MacOS X Tiger (x86)
- MacOS X Leopard (x86)

Other operating systems have not been tested, but Phusion Passenger will probably
work fine on them. Please

if it doesn't.


== Installing Phusion Passenger ==

=== Generic installation instructions ===

[[install_passenger]]
==== Overview of download and installation methods ====

There are two ways to install Phusion Passenger:

1. By installing the Phusion Passenger gem, as instructed on the
   link:http://www.modrails.com/install.html[``Install'' page on the Phusion
   Passenger website].
2. By downloading a native Linux package (e.g. Debian package) from the
   Phusion Passenger website.
3. By downloading the source tarball from the Phusion Passenger website
   ('passenger-x.x.x.tar.gz').

In our opinion, installing the gem or the native package is easiest.

Phusion Passenger provides an easy-to-use installer for installing the Phusion
Passenger Apache module ('mod_passenger').

TIP: You might have to run the installation commands in the following sections
as 'root'. If the installer fails because of permission errors, it will tell
you.

[[specifying_correct_apache_install]]
==== Specifying the correct Apache installation ====

NOTE: You can skip this section if you've installed Phusion Passenger via a
native Linux package, because no compilation is necessary.

If your system has multiple Apache installations (this is likely the case on
MacOS X), then you will need to tell the Phusion Passenger installer which one
to use. If you only have one Apache installation (the case on most Linux
systems), then you can skip this section because Phusion Passenger will
automatically detect it.

Every Apache installation has its own `apxs` program. You will need to tell
Phusion Passenger the location of this program, by specifying the `APXS2`
environment variable. Suppose that you want to use the Apache installation in
'/opt/apache2'. Then, assuming that the corresponding `apxs` program is located
'/opt/apache2/bin/apxs', type:
----------------------------------
export APXS2=/opt/apache2/bin/apxs
----------------------------------

NOTE: On some systems, the `apxs` program might be called `apxs2`, and it might
be located in the `sbin` folder instead of the `bin` folder.

[[specifying_ruby_installation]]
==== Specifying the correct Ruby installation ====

NOTE: You can skip this section if you've installed Phusion Passenger via a
native Linux package, because no compilation is necessary.

If your system has multiple Ruby installations (this is likely the case on
MacOS X), then you will need to tell the Phusion Passenger installer which one
to use. If you only have one Ruby installation (the case on most Linux systems),
then you can skip this section because Phusion Passenger will automatically detect it.

To specify the Ruby installation, prepend your Ruby installation's `bin`
directory to the `PATH` environment variable. For example, if you have the
following Ruby installations:

- /usr/bin/ruby
- /opt/myruby/bin/ruby

and you want to use the latter, then type:

----------------------------------
export PATH=/opt/myruby/bin:$PATH
----------------------------------


==== Installing via the gem ====

Please install the gem and then run the Phusion Passenger installer, by typing the
following commands:
------------------------------------------------------
gem install passenger-x.x.x.gem
passenger-install-apache2-module
------------------------------------------------------
Please follow the instructions given by the installer.

==== Installing via a native Linux package ====

Please install the native Linux package, e.g.:
------------------------------------------------------
gdebi passenger_x.x.x-i386.deb
------------------------------------------------------

Next, you'll need to configure Apache. Run the "installer", as it will tell you
the correct configuration options for Apache:
------------------------------------------------------
passenger-install-apache2-module
------------------------------------------------------

NOTE: The installer doesn't actually install anything because it will automatically
detect that Phusion Passenger has already been installed. The only thing the
installer will do in this case, is showing the correct Apache configurations.

==== Installing via the source tarball ====

Extract the tarball to whatever location you prefer. The Phusion Passenger files
are to reside in that location permanently. For example, if you would like
Phusion Passenger to reside in `/opt/passenger-x.x.x`:
------------------------------------------------------
cd /opt
tar xzvf ~/YourDownloadsFolder/passenger-x.x.x.tar.gz
------------------------------------------------------

Next, run the included installer:
------------------------------------------------------
/opt/passenger-x.x.x/bin/passenger-install-apache2-module
------------------------------------------------------
Please follow the instructions given by the installer.

IMPORTANT: Please do not remove the 'passenger-x.x.x' folder after
installation. Furthermore, the 'passenger-x.x.x' folder must be accessible by Apache.


=== Operating system-specific instructions and information ===

==== MacOS X ====

Ben Ruebenstein has written an excellent
link:http://benr75.com/articles/2008/04/12/setup-mod_rails-phusion-mac-os-x-leopard[tutorial
on installing Phusion Passenger on OS X].

==== Ubuntu Linux ====

== Deploying a Ruby on Rails application ==

Suppose you have a Ruby on Rails application in '/webapps/mycook', and you own
the domain 'www.mycook.com'. You can either deploy your application to the
virtual host's root (i.e. the application will be accessible from the root URL,
'http://www.mycook.com/'), or in a sub URI (i.e. the application will be
accessible from a sub URL, such as 'http://www.mycook.com/railsapplication').

NOTE: The default `RAILS_ENV` environment in which deployed Rails applications
are run, is ``production''. You can change this by changing the
<<rails_env,'RailsEnv'>> configuration option.

=== Deploying to a virtual host's root ===

Add a virtual host entry to your Apache configuration file. The virtual host's
document root must point to your Ruby on Rails application's 'public' folder.
For example:
-------------------------------------------
<VirtualHost *:80>
    ServerName www.mycook.com
    DocumentRoot /webapps/mycook/public
</VirtualHost>
-------------------------------------------
Then restart Apache. The application has now been deployed.

[[deploying_rails_to_sub_uri]]
=== Deploying to a sub URI ===

Suppose that you already have a virtual host:

-------------------------------------------
<VirtualHost *:80>
    ServerName www.phusion.nl
    DocumentRoot /websites/phusion
</VirtualHost>
-------------------------------------------

And you want your Ruby on Rails application to be accessible from the URL
'http://www.phusion.nl/rails'.

To do this, make a symlink from your Ruby on Rails application's 'public'
folder to a directory in the document root. For example:
-------------------------------------------
ln -s /webapps/mycook/public /websites/phusion/rails
-------------------------------------------

Next, add a <<RailsBaseURI,RailsBaseURI>> option to the virtual host configuration:
-------------------------------------------
<VirtualHost *:80>
    ServerName www.phusion.nl
    DocumentRoot /websites/phusion
    RailsBaseURI /rails                # This line has been added.
</VirtualHost>
-------------------------------------------
Then restart Apache. The application has now been deployed.

[TIP]
======================================
You can deploy multiple Rails applications under a virtual host, by specifying
<<RailsBaseURI,RailsBaseURI>> multiple times. For example:
---------------------------------
<VirtualHost *:80>
    ....
    RailsBaseURI /app1
    RailsBaseURI /app2
    RailsBaseURI /app3
</VirtualHost>
---------------------------------
======================================

=== Redeploying (restarting the Ruby on Rails application) ===

Deploying a new version of a Ruby on Rails application is as simple as
re-uploading the application files, and restarting the application.

There are two ways to restart the application:

1. By restarting Apache.
2. By creating or modifying the file 'tmp/restart.txt' in the Rails
   application's root folder. Phusion Passenger will automatically
   restart the application.

For example, to restart our example MyCook application, we type this in the
command line:
-------------------------------------------
touch /webapps/mycook/tmp/restart.txt
-------------------------------------------

=== Migrations ===

Phusion Passenger is not related to Ruby on Rails migrations in any way. To
run migrations on your deployment server, please login to your deployment
server (e.g. with 'ssh') and type `rake db:migrate RAILS_ENV=production` in
a shell console, just like one would normally run migrations.

=== Capistrano integration ===

See <<capistrano,Capistrano recipe>>.


== Deploying a Rack-based Ruby application ==

Phusion Passenger supports arbitrary Ruby web applications that follow the
link:http://rack.rubyforge.org/[Rack] interface.

Phusion Passenger assumes that Rack application directories have a certain layout.
Suppose that you have a Rack application in '/webapps/rackapp'. Then that
folder must contain at least two entries:

- 'config.ru', a Rackup file for starting the Rack application. This file must contain
  the complete logic for initializing the application.
- 'public/', a folder containing public static web assets, like images and stylesheets.
- 'tmp/', used for 'restart.txt' (our application restart mechanism). This will
  be explained in a following subsection.

So '/webapps/rackapp' must, at minimum, look like this:
----------------------
/webapps/rackapp
  |
  +-- config.ru
  |
  +-- public/
  |
  +-- tmp/
----------------------

Suppose you own the domain 'www.rackapp.com'. You can either deploy your application
to the virtual host's root (i.e. the application will be accessible from the root URL,
'http://www.rackapp.com/'), or in a sub URI (i.e. the application will be
accessible from a sub URL, such as 'http://www.rackapp.com/rackapp').

NOTE: The default `RACK_ENV` environment in which deployed Rack applications
are run, is ``production''. You can change this by changing the
<<rack_env,'RackEnv'>> configuration option.

=== Tutorial/example: writing and deploying a Hello World Rack application ===

First we create a Phusion Passenger-compliant Rack directory structure:

-------------------------------------------
$ mkdir /webapps/rack_example
$ mkdir /webapps/rack_example/public
$ mkdir /webapps/rack_example/tmp
-------------------------------------------

Next, we write a minimal "hello world" Rack application:

-------------------------------------------
$ cd /webapps/rack_example
$ some_awesome_editor config.ru
...type in some source code...
$ cat config.ru
app = proc do |env|
    return [200, { "Content-Type" => "text/html" }, "hello <b>world</b>"]
end
run app
-------------------------------------------

Finally, we deploy it by adding the following configuration options to
the Apache configuration file:

-------------------------------------------
<VirtualHost *:80>
    ServerName www.rackexample.com
    DocumentRoot /webapps/rack_example/public
</VirtualHost>
-------------------------------------------

And we're done! After an Apache restart, the above Rack application will be available
under the URL 'http://www.rackexample.com/'.

=== Deploying to a virtual host's root ===

Add a virtual host entry to your Apache configuration file. The virtual host's
document root must point to your Rack application's 'public' folder.
For example:
-------------------------------------------
<VirtualHost *:80>
    ServerName www.rackapp.com
    DocumentRoot /webapps/rackapp/public
</VirtualHost>
-------------------------------------------
Then restart Apache. The application has now been deployed.

[[deploying_rack_to_sub_uri]]
=== Deploying to a sub URI ===

Suppose that you already have a virtual host:

-------------------------------------------
<VirtualHost *:80>
    ServerName www.phusion.nl
    DocumentRoot /websites/phusion
</VirtualHost>
-------------------------------------------

And you want your Rack application to be accessible from the URL
'http://www.phusion.nl/rack'.

To do this, make a symlink from your Rack application's 'public'
folder to a directory in the document root. For example:
-------------------------------------------
ln -s /webapps/rackapp/public /websites/phusion/rack
-------------------------------------------

Next, add a <<RackBaseURI,RackBaseURI>> option to the virtual host configuration:
-------------------------------------------
<VirtualHost *:80>
    ServerName www.phusion.nl
    DocumentRoot /websites/phusion
    RackBaseURI /rack                # This line has been added.
</VirtualHost>
-------------------------------------------
Then restart Apache. The application has now been deployed.

[TIP]
======================================
You can deploy multiple Rack applications under a virtual host, by specifying
<<RackBaseURI,RackBaseURI>> multiple times. For example:
---------------------------------
<VirtualHost *:80>
    ....
    RackBaseURI /app1
    RackBaseURI /app2
    RackBaseURI /app3
</VirtualHost>
---------------------------------
======================================

=== Redeploying (restarting the Rack application) ===

Deploying a new version of a Rack application is as simple as
re-uploading the application files, and restarting the application.

There are two ways to restart the application:

1. By restarting Apache.
2. By creating or modifying the file 'tmp/restart.txt' in the Rack
   application's root folder. Phusion Passenger will automatically restart the
   application.

For example, to restart our example application, we type this in the
command line:
-------------------------------------------
touch /webapps/rackapp/tmp/restart.txt
-------------------------------------------

=== Rackup specifications for various web frameworks ===

This subsection shows example 'config.ru' files for various web frameworks.

==== Camping ====
------------------------------------------------------
require 'rubygems'
require 'rack'
require 'camping'

##### Begin Camping application
Camping.goes :Blog

...your application code here...
##### End Camping application

run Rack::Adapter::Camping.new(Blog)
------------------------------------------------------

For Camping versions 2.0 and up, using `run Blog` as the final line will do.

==== Halcyon ====
------------------------------------------------------
require 'rubygems'
require 'halcyon'
$LOAD_PATH.unshift(Halcyon.root / 'lib')
Halcyon::Runner.load_config Halcyon.root/'config'/'config.yml'
run Halcyon::Runner.new
------------------------------------------------------

==== Mack ====
------------------------------------------------------
ENV["MACK_ENV"] = ENV["RACK_ENV"]
load("Rakefile")
require 'rubygems'
require 'mack'
run Mack::Utils::Server.build_app
------------------------------------------------------

==== Merb ====
------------------------------------------------------
require 'rubygems'
require 'merb-core'

Merb::Config.setup(:merb_root   => ".",
                   :environment => ENV['RACK_ENV'])
Merb.environment = Merb::Config[:environment]
Merb.root = Merb::Config[:merb_root]
Merb::BootLoader.run

run Merb::Rack::Application.new

)

### ...your Sinatra application code here... ###

run Sinatra.application
------------------------------------------------------


== Configuring Phusion Passenger ==

After installation, Phusion Passenger does not need any further configurations.
Nevertheless, the system administrator may be interested in changing
Phusion Passenger's behavior. Phusion Passenger's Apache module supports the
following configuration options:

=== PassengerRoot <directory> ===
The location to the Phusion Passenger root directory. This configuration option
is essential to Phusion Passenger. The correct value is given by the installer,
and should usually not be changed manually.

This required option may only occur once, in the global server configuration.

=== PassengerLogLevel <integer> ===
This option allows one to specify how much information Phusion Passenger should
write to the Apache error log file. A higher log level value means that more
information will be logged.

Possible values are:

- '0': Show only errors and warnings.
- '1': Show the most important debugging information. This might be useful for
       system administrators who are trying to figure out the cause of a
       problem.
- '2': Show more debugging information. This is typically only useful for developers.
- '3': Show even more debugging information.

This option may only occur once, in the global server configuration.
The default is '0'.

[[PassengerRuby]]
=== PassengerRuby <filename> ===
This option allows one to specify the Ruby interpreter to use.

This option may only occur once, in the global server configuration.
The default is 'ruby'.

[[PassengerUserSwitching]]
=== PassengerUserSwitching <on|off> ===
Whether to enable <<user_switching,user switching support>>.

This option may only occur once, in the global server configuration.
The default value is 'on'.

[[PassengerDefaultUser]]
=== PassengerDefaultUser <username> ===
Passenger enables <<user_switching,user switching support>> by default.
This configuration option allows one to specify which user Rails/Rack
applications must run as, if user switching fails or is disabled.

This option may only occur once, in the global server configuration.
The default value is 'nobody'.

=== Resource control and optimization options ===

==== PassengerMaxPoolSize <integer> ====
The maximum number of Ruby on Rails or Rack application instances that may
be simultaneously active. A larger number results in higher memory usage,
but improved ability to handle concurrent HTTP clients.

The optimal value depends on your system's hardware and the server's average
load. You should experiment with different values. But generally speaking,
the value should be at least equal to the number of CPUs (or CPU cores) that
you have. If your system has 2 GB of RAM, then we recommend a value of '30'.
If your system is a Virtual Private Server (VPS) and has about 256 MB RAM, and
is also running other services such as MySQL, then we recommend a value of '2'.

If you find that your server is unable to handle the load on your Rails/Rack websites
(i.e. running out of memory) then you should lower this value. (Though if your
sites are really that popular, then you should strongly consider upgrading your
hardware or getting more servers.)

This option may only occur once, in the global server configuration.
The default value is '6'.

TIP: We strongly recommend you to <<reducing_memory_usage,use Ruby Enterprise
Edition>>. This allows you to reduce the memory usage of your Ruby on Rails applications
by about 33%. And it's not hard to install.

==== PassengerMaxInstancesPerApp <integer> ====
The maximum number of application instances that may be simultaneously active
for a single application. This helps to make sure that a single application
will not occupy all available slots in the application pool.

This value must be less than <<PassengerMaxPoolSize,PassengerMaxPoolSize>>. A value of 0
means that there is no limit placed on the number of instances a single application
may use, i.e. only the global limit of <<PassengerMaxPoolSize,PassengerMaxPoolSize>>
will be enforced.

This option may only occur once, in the global server configuration.
The default value is '0'.

[[PassengerPoolIdleTime]]
==== PassengerPoolIdleTime <integer> ====
The maximum number of seconds that a Ruby on Rails or Rack application instance
may be idle. That is, if an application instance hasn't done anything after
the given number of seconds, then it will be shutdown in order to conserve
memory.

Decreasing this value means that applications will have to be spawned
more often. Since spawning is a relatively slow operation, some visitors may
notice a small delay when they visit your Rails/Rack website. However, it will also
free up resources used by applications more quickly.

The optimal value depends on the average time that a visitor spends on a single
Rails/Rack web page. We recommend a value of `2 * x`, where `x` is the average
number of seconds that a visitor spends on a single Rails/Rack web page. But your
mileage may vary.

When this value is set to '0', application instances will not be shutdown unless 
it's really necessary, i.e. when Phusion Passenger is out of worker processes
for a given application and one of the inactive application instances needs to
make place for another application instance. Setting the value to 0 is
recommended if you're on a non-shared host that's only running a few
applications, each which must be available at all times.

This option may only occur once, in the global server configuration.
The default value is '300'.

=== Ruby on Rails-specific options ===

==== RailsAutoDetect <on|off> ====
Whether Phusion Passenger should automatically detect whether a virtual host's
document root is a Ruby on Rails application. The default is 'on'.

This option may occur in the global server configuration or in a virtual host
configuration block.

For example, consider the following configuration:

-----------------------------
RailsAutoDetect off
<VirtualHost *:80>
    ServerName www.mycook.com
    DocumentRoot /webapps/mycook/public
</VirtualHost>
-----------------------------

If one goes to 'http://www.mycook.com/', the visitor will see the contents of
the '/webapps/mycook/public' folder, instead of the output of the Ruby on Rails
application.

It is possible to explicitly specify that the host is a Ruby on Rails
application by using the <<RailsBaseURI,RailsBaseURI>> configuration option:

-----------------------------
RailsAutoDetect off
<VirtualHost *:80>
    ServerName www.mycook.com
    DocumentRoot /webapps/mycook/public
    RailsBaseURI /           # This line has been added.
</VirtualHost>
-----------------------------

[[RailsBaseURI]]
==== RailsBaseURI <uri> ====
Used to specify that the given URI is a Rails application. See
<<deploying_rails_to_sub_uri,Deploying Rails to a sub URI>> for an example.

It is allowed to specify this option multiple times. Do this to deploy multiple
Rails applications in different sub-URIs under the same virtual host.

This option may occur in the global server configuration or in a
virtual host configuration block.

[[RailsAllowModRewrite]]
==== RailsAllowModRewrite <on|off> ====
If enabled, Phusion Passenger will not override mod_rewrite rules. Please read
<<conflicting_apache_modules,Conflicting Apache modules>> for details.

This option may occur once, in the global server configuration or in a virtual host
configuration block. The default value is 'off'.

[[rails_env]]
==== RailsEnv <string> ====
This option allows one to specify the default `RAILS_ENV` value.

This option may occur once, in the global server configuration or in a virtual host
configuration block. The default value is 'production'.

[[RailsSpawnMethod]]
==== RailsSpawnMethod <string> ====
[TIP]
."What spawn method should I use?"
=========================================================
This subsection attempts to describe spawn methods, but it's okay if you don't (want to)
understand it, as it's mostly a technical detail. You can basically follow this rule of thumb:

************************************************
If your application works on Mongrel, but not on Phusion Passenger, then set
`RailsSpawnMethod` to 'conservative'. Otherwise, leave it at 'smart' (the default).
************************************************

However, we do recommend you to try to understand it. The 'smart' spawn method brings
many benefits.
=========================================================

Internally, Phusion Passenger spawns multiple Ruby on Rails processes in order to handle
requests. But there are multiple ways with which processes can be spawned, each having
its own set of pros and cons. Supported spawn methods are:

smart::
When this spawn method is used, Phusion Passenger will attempt to cache Ruby on Rails
framework code and application code for a limited period of time.
+
*Pros:*
This can significantly decrease spawn time (by as much as 90%). And, when Ruby Enterprise
Edition is used, <<reducing_memory_usage,memory usage can be reduced by 33% on average>>.
+
*Cons:*
Some Ruby on Rails applications and libraries are not compatible with smart spawning.
If that's the case for your application, then you should use 'conservative' as
spawning method.

conservative::
This spawning method is similar to the one used in Mongrel Cluster. It does not perform
any code caching at all.
+
*Pros:*
Conservative spawning is guaranteed to be compatible with all applications and libraries.
+
*Cons:*
Much slower than smart spawning. Every spawn action will be equally slow, though no slower than
the startup time of a single server in Mongrel Cluster. Conservative spawning will also
render <<reducing_memory_usage,Ruby Enterprise Edition's memory reduction technology>> useless.

This option may occur once, in the global server configuration or in a virtual host
configuration block. The default value is 'smart'.

=== Rack-specific options ===

==== RackAutoDetect <on|off> ====
Whether Phusion Passenger should automatically detect whether a virtual host's
document root is a Rack application. The default is 'on'.

This option may occur in the global server configuration or in a virtual host
configuration block.

For example, consider the following configuration:

-----------------------------
RackAutoDetect off
<VirtualHost *:80>
    ServerName www.rackapp.com
    DocumentRoot /webapps/my_rack_app/public
</VirtualHost>
-----------------------------

If one goes to 'http://www.rackapp.com/', the visitor will see the contents of
the '/webapps/my_rack_app/public' folder, instead of the output of the Rack
application.

It is possible to explicitly specify that the host is a Rack
application by using the <<RackBaseURI,RackBaseURI>> configuration option:

-----------------------------
RackAutoDetect off
<VirtualHost *:80>
    ServerName www.rackapp.com
    DocumentRoot /webapps/my_rack_app/public
    RackBaseURI /       # This line was added
</VirtualHost>
-----------------------------

[[RackBaseURI]]
==== RackBaseURI <uri> ====
Used to specify that the given URI is a Rack application. See
<<deploying_rack_to_sub_uri,Deploying Rack to a sub URI>> for an example.

It is allowed to specify this option multiple times. Do this to deploy multiple
Rack applications in different sub-URIs under the same virtual host.

This option may occur in the global server configuration or in a
virtual host configuration block.

[[rack_env]]
==== RackEnv <string> ====
The given value will be accessible in Rack applications in the `RACK_ENV`
environment variable. This allows one to define the environment in which
Rack applications are run, very similar to `RAILS_ENV`.

This option may occur once, in the global server configuration or in a virtual host
configuration block. The default value is 'production'.

=== Deprecated options ===

The following options have been deprecated, but are still supported for backwards
compatibility reasons.

==== RailsRuby ====
Deprecated in favor of <<PassengerRuby,PassengerRuby>>.

==== RailsUserSwitching ====
Deprecated in favor of <<PassengerUserSwitching,PassengerUserSwitching>>.

==== RailsDefaultUser ====
Deprecated in favor of <<PassengerDefaultUser,PassengerDefaultUser>>.


== Troubleshooting ==

=== Operating system-specific problems ===

==== MacOS X: The installer cannot locate MAMP's Apache ====

.Symptoms
*******************************************************************************
The installer finds Apache 2 development headers at `/Applications/MAMP/Library/bin/apxs`.
However, Apache cannot be found. The installer also outputs the following error:
------------------------------------
cannot open /Applications/MAMP/Library/build/config_vars.mk:
No such file or directory at /Applications/MAMP/Library/bin/apxs line 218.
------------------------------------
*******************************************************************************

Your MAMP installation seems to be broken. In particular, 'config_vars.mk' is missing.
Please read link:http://forum.mamp.info/viewtopic.php?t=1866[this forum topic] to learn how
to fix this problem.

See also link:http://code.google.com/p/phusion-passenger/issues/detail?id=12[this bug report].


=== Problems during installation ===

[[installing_ruby_dev]]
==== Ruby development headers aren't installed ====

.Symptoms
*******************************************************************************
Installing Phusion Passenger fails because of one of the following errors:

- The Phusion Passenger installer tells you that the Ruby development headers
  aren't installed.
- The error message ``'no such file to load -- mkmf''' occurs.
- The error message ``'ruby.h: No such file or directory''' occurs.
*******************************************************************************

Phusion Passenger makes use of a native extension, so the Ruby development headers
must be installed. On most Linux systems, Ruby and the Ruby development headers
are contained in separate packages, so having Ruby installed does not
automatically imply having the development headers installed.

Here's how you can install the development headers:

==== Apache development headers aren't installed ====

.Symptoms
*******************************************************************************
Installing Phusion Passenger fails because of one of the following errors:

- The installer says that the Apache development headers aren't installed.
- The error message ``'httpd.h: No such file or directory''' occurs.
+
(Instead of 'httpd.h', the message might also be 'http_config.h' or something
else similar to 'http_*.h'.)

==== APR development headers aren't installed ====

.Symptoms
*******************************************************************************
Installing Phusion Passenger fails because one of the following errors:

- The installer tells you that APR development headers aren't installed.
- The error message ``'apr_pools.h: No such file or directory''' occurs.
- The error message ``'apr_strings.h: No such file or directory''' occurs.

	The APR development are bundled with Apache. If the APR headers aren't,
	then it probably means that they have been removed after Apache's been
	installed. Please reinstall Apache to get back the APR headers.


==== Phusion Passenger is using the wrong Apache during installation ====

Please <<specifying_correct_apache_install,Specifying the correct Apache
installation>>, and re-run the Phusion Passenger installer.


==== Phusion Passenger is using the wrong Ruby during installation ====

Please <<specifying_ruby_installation,Specifying the correct Ruby
installation>>, and re-run the Phusion Passenger installer.


=== Problems after installation ===

[TIP]
.The golden tip: read your Apache error logs!
=====================================================
'mod_passenger' will write all errors to the Apache error log. So if
you're experiencing post-installation problems, please look
inside the Apache error logs. It will tell you what exactly went wrong.
=====================================================

==== My Rails application works on Mongrel, but not on Phusion Passenger ====

Please try setting <<RailsSpawnMethod,RailsSpawnMethod>> to 'conservative'.

==== Phusion Passenger has been compiled against the wrong Apache installation ====

.Symptoms
*******************************************************************************
Apache crashes during startup (after being daemonized). The Apache error log
says ``'seg fault or similar nasty error detected in the parent process'''.
*******************************************************************************

This problem is most likely to occur on MacOS X. Most OS X users have multiple
Apache installations on their system.

To solve this problem, please <<specifying_correct_apache_install,specify the
correct Apache installation>>, and <<install_passenger,reinstall Phusion
Passenger>>.

==== I get a "304 Forbidden" error ====

See next subsection.

==== Static assets such as images and stylesheets aren't being displayed ====

Static assets are accelerated, i.e. they are served directly by Apache and do not
go through the Rails stack. There are two reasons why Apache doesn't serve static
assets correctly:

1. Your Apache configuration is too strict, and does not allow HTTP clients to
   access static assets. This can be achieved with an `Allow from all` directive
   in the correct place. For example:
+
-----------------------------------------
<Directory "/webapps/mycook/public">
   Options FollowSymLinks
   AllowOverride None
   Order allow,deny
   Allow from all
</Directory>
-----------------------------------------
+
See also link:http://groups.google.com/group/phusion-passenger/browse_thread/thread/9699a639a87f85f4/b9d71a03bf2670a5[this discussion].

2. The Apache process doesn't have permission to access your Rails application's folder.
   Please make sure that the Rails application's folder, as well as all of its parent folders,
   have the correct permissions and/or ownerships.

==== The Apache error log says that the spawn manager script does not exist, or that it does not have permission to execute it ====

If you are sure that the 'PassengerRoot' configuration option is set correctly,
then this problem is most likely caused by the fact that you're running Apache
with SELinux. On Fedora, CentOS and RedHat Enterprise Linux, Apache is locked
down by SELinux policies.

To solve this problem, you must set some permissions on the Phusion Passenger files
and folders, so that Apache can access them.

- If you've installed Phusion Passenger via a gem, then run this command to determine
  Phusion Passenger's root folder:
+
------------------------------------------------------------------
passenger-config --root
------------------------------------------------------------------
+
Next, run the following command:
+
------------------------------------------------------------------
chcon -R -h -t httpd_sys_content_t /path-to-passenger-root
------------------------------------------------------------------
+
where '/path-to-passenger-root' should be replaced with whatever
`passenger-config --root` printed.

- If you've installed Phusion Passenger via the source tarball, then run the following
  command:
+
------------------------------------------------------------------
chcon -R -h -t httpd_sys_content_t /path/to/passenger/folder
------------------------------------------------------------------

Once the permissions are fixed, restart Apache.

==== The Rails application reports that it's unable to start because of a permission error ====

Please check whether your Rails application's folder has the correct
permissions. By default, Rails applications are started as the owner of the
file 'config/environment.rb', except if the file is owned by root. If the
file is owned by root, then the Rails application will be started as 'nobody'
(or as the user specify by <<RailsDefaultUser,RailsDefaultUser>>, if that's
specified).

Please read <<user_switching,User switching (security)>> for details.

==== My Rails application's log file is not being written to ====

There are a couple things that you should be aware of:

- By default, Phusion Passenger runs Rails applications in 'production' mode,
  so please be sure to check 'production.log' instead of 'development.log'. See
  <<RailsEnv,RailsEnv>> for configuration.
- By default, Phusion Passenger runs Rails applications as the owner of 'environment.rb'.
  So the log file can only be written to if that user has write permission to the
  log file. Please 'chmod' or 'chown' your log file accordingly.
+
See <<User_switching,User switching (security)>> for details.

If you're using a RedHat-derived Linux distribution (such as Fedora or CentOS)
then it is link:http://code.google.com/p/phusion-passenger/issues/detail?id=4[possible
that SELinux is interfering]. RedHat's SELinux policy only allows Apache to read/write
directories that have the 'httpd_sys_content_t' security context. Please run the
following command to give your Rails application folder that context:

-----------------------------------------------------------
chcon -R -h -t httpd_sys_content_t /path/to/your/rails/app
-----------------------------------------------------------


[[conflicting_apache_modules]]
=== Conflicting Apache modules ===

==== mod_rewrite and mod_alias ====

Phusion Passenger conflicts with 'mod_rewrite' and 'mod_alias'. Those modules may be
installed and loaded together with 'mod_passenger', and they will work fine
outside virtual hosts that contain a Rails application, but we recommend you
not to use their features inside virtual hosts that contain a Rails
application.

By default, Phusion Passenger will override mod_rewrite rules on Rails hosts.
This is because the default .htaccess, as provided by Ruby on Rails, redirects all
requests to `dispatch.cgi' using mod_rewrite. This is a CGI application which
loads the entire Ruby on Rails framework for every request, and thus is very
slow. If we do not override mod_rewrite, then Ruby on Rails apps will be slow
on Phusion Passenger by default -- but we want a good out-of-the-box experience.

Furthermore, the primary reason why people use mod_rewrite with Rails
applications, is to accelerate page caching. Phusion Passenger supports page
caching out-of-the-box, without mod_rewrite.

It is not fully understood how mod_alias conflicts with Phusion Passenger, but we
recommend you not to use it on Rails virtual hosts. mod_alias rules can result
in surprising problems.

If you really want to use mod_rewrite on Rails virtual hosts, then please set
the <<RailsAllowModRewrite,RailsAllowModRewrite>> configuration option. But
please note that you will have to delete Rails applications' default .htaccess
file, or add rewrite rules to negate its effects.

==== mod_userdir ====

'mod_userdir' is not compatible with Phusion Passenger at the moment.

==== VirtualDocumentRoot ====

VirtualDocumentRoot is not compatible with Phusion Passenger at the moment.


== Analysis and system maintenance tools ==

Phusion Passenger provides a set of tools, which are useful for system analysis,
maintenance and troubleshooting.


=== Inspecting memory usage ===

Process inspection tools such as `ps` and `top` are useful, but they
link:http://groups.google.com/group/phusion-passenger/msg/1fd1c233456d3180[rarely show the correct memory usage].
The real memory usage is usually lower than what `ps` and `top` report.

There are many technical reasons why this is so, but an explanation is beyond
the scope of this Users Guide. We kindly refer the interested reader to
operating systems literature about 'virtual memory' and 'copy-on-write'.

The tool `passenger-memory-stats` allows one to easily analyze Phusion Passenger's
and Apache's real memory usage. For example:

-------------------------------------------------------
[bash@localhost root]# passenger-memory-stats
------------- Apache processes --------------.
PID    PPID  Threads  VMSize   Private  Name
---------------------------------------------.
5947   1     9        90.6 MB  0.5 MB   /usr/sbin/apache2 -k start
5948   5947  1        18.9 MB  0.7 MB   /usr/sbin/fcgi-pm -k start
6029   5947  1        42.7 MB  0.5 MB   /usr/sbin/apache2 -k start
6030   5947  1        42.7 MB  0.5 MB   /usr/sbin/apache2 -k start
6031   5947  1        42.5 MB  0.3 MB   /usr/sbin/apache2 -k start
6033   5947  1        42.5 MB  0.4 MB   /usr/sbin/apache2 -k start
6034   5947  1        50.5 MB  0.4 MB   /usr/sbin/apache2 -k start
23482  5947  1        82.6 MB  0.4 MB   /usr/sbin/apache2 -k start
### Processes: 8
### Total private dirty RSS: 3.50 MB

--------- Passenger processes ---------.
PID    Threads  VMSize   Private  Name
---------------------------------------.
6026   1        10.9 MB  4.7 MB   Passenger spawn server
23481  1        26.7 MB  3.0 MB   Passenger FrameworkSpawner: 2.0.2
23791  1        26.8 MB  2.9 MB   Passenger ApplicationSpawner: /var/www/projects/app1-foobar
23793  1        26.9 MB  17.1 MB  Rails: /var/www/projects/app1-foobar
### Processes: 4
### Total private dirty RSS: 27.76 M
-------------------------------------------------------

The 'Private' or 'private dirty RSS' field shows the *real* memory usage of processes. Here,
we see that all the Apache worker processes only take less than 1 MB memory each.
This is a lot less than the 50 MB-ish memory usage as shown in the 'VMSize' column
(which is what a lot of people think is the real memory usage, but is actually not).

NOTE: This tool only works on Linux. Unfortunately other operating systems don't
provide facilities for determining processes' private dirty RSS.


=== Inspecting Phusion Passenger's internal status ===

One can inspect Phusion Passenger's internal status with the tool `passenger-status`.
This tool must typically be run as root. For example:

--------------------------------------------------
[bash@localhost root]# passenger-status
----------- General information -----------
max      = 6
count    = 1
active   = 0
inactive = 1

----------- Domains -----------
/var/www/projects/app1-foobar: 
  PID: 9617      Sessions: 0
--------------------------------------------------

The 'general information' section shows the following information:

max:: The maximum number of application instances that Phusion Passenger will
spawn. This equals the value given for <<PassengerMaxPoolSize,PassengerMaxPoolSize>>.
count:: The number of application instances that are currently alive. This value
is always less than or equal to 'max'.
active:: The number of application instances that are currently processing
requests. This value is always less than or equal to 'count'.
inactive:: The number of application instances that are currently *not* processing
requests, i.e. are idle. Idle application instances will be shutdown after a while,
as can be specified with <<PassengerPoolIdleTime,PassengerPoolIdleTime>> (unless this
value is set to 0, in which case application instances are never shut down via idle
time). The value of 'inactive' equals `count - active`.

The 'domains' section shows, for each application directory, information about running
application instances. The 'sessions' field shows how many HTTP client are currently
in the queue of that application instance, waiting to be processed.

Since Phusion Passenger uses fair load balancing by default, the number of sessions for the
application instances should be fairly close to each other. For example, this is fairly
normal:
--------------------------------
  PID: 4281      Sessions: 2
  PID: 4268      Sessions: 0
  PID: 4265      Sessions: 1
  PID: 4275      Sessions: 1
--------------------------------

But if you see a "spike", i.e. an application instance has an unusually high number of
sessions compared to the others, then there might be a problem:
--------------------------------
  PID: 4281      Sessions: 2
  PID: 17468     Sessions: 8     <---- "spike"
  PID: 4265      Sessions: 1
  PID: 4275      Sessions: 1
--------------------------------

Possible reasons why spikes can occur:

. Your application is busy processing a request that takes a very long time.
. Your application is frozen, i.e. has stopped responding. See
  <<debugging_frozen,Debugging frozen applications>> for tips.


[[debugging_frozen]]
=== Debugging frozen applications ===

If one of your application instances is frozen (stopped responding), then you
can figure out where it is frozen by killing it with 'SIGABRT'. This will cause the
application to raise an exception, with a backtrace.

The exception (with full backtrace information) is normally logged into the Apache
error log. But if your application or if its web framework has its own exception logging
routines, then exceptions might be logged into the application's log files instead.
This is the case with Ruby on Rails. So if you kill a Ruby on Rails application with
'SIGABRT', please check the application's 'production.log' first (assuming that you're
running it in a 'production' environment). If you don't see a backtrace there, check
the Apache error log.

NOTE: It is safe to kill application instances, even in live environments. Phusion Passenger
will restart killed application instances, as if nothing bad happened.


== Tips ==

[[user_switching]]
=== User switching (security) ===

There is a problem that plagues most PHP web host, namely the fact that all PHP
applications are run in the same user context as the web server. So for
example, Joe's PHP application will be able to read Jane's PHP application's
passwords. This is obviously undesirable on many servers.

Phusion Passenger solves this problem by implementing 'user switching'. A Rails
application is started as the owner of the file 'config/environment.rb',
and a Rack application is started as the owner of the file 'config.ru'.
So if '/home/webapps/foo/config/environment.rb' is owned by 'joe', then Phusion
Passenger will launch the corresponding Rails application as 'joe' as well.

This behavior is the default, and you don't need to configure anything. But
there are things that you should keep in mind:

- The owner of 'environment.rb' must have read access to the Rails application's
  folder, and read/write access to the Rails application's 'logs' folder.
  Likewise, the owner of 'config.ru' must have read access to the Rack application's
  folder.
- This feature is only available if Apache is started by 'root'. This is the
  case on most Apache installations.
- Under no circumstances will applications be run as 'root'. If
  'environment.rb'/'config.ru' is owned as root or by an unknown user, then the
  Rails/Rack application will run as the user specified by
  <<PassengerDefaultUser,PassengerDefaultUser>>.

User switching can be disabled with the
<<PassengerUserSwitching,PassengerUserSwitching>> option.


[[reducing_memory_usage]]
=== Reducing memory consumption of Ruby on Rails applications by 33% ===

Is it possible to reduce memory consumption of your Rails applications by 33% on average,
by using http://www.rubyenterpriseedition.com/[Ruby Enterprise Edition].
Please visit the website for details.

Note that this feature does not apply to Rack applications.

[[capistrano]]
=== Capistrano recipe ===

Phusion Passenger can be combined with link:http://capify.org/[Capistrano].
The following Capistrano recipe demonstrates Phusion Passenger support.
It assumes that you're using Git as version control system.

--------------------------------------------------
set :application, "myapp"
set :domain,      "example.com"
set :repository,  "ssh://#{domain}/path-to-your-git-repo/#{application}.git"
set :use_sudo,    false
set :deploy_to,   "/path-to-your-web-app-directory/#{application}"
set :scm,         "git"

role :app, domain
role :web, domain
role :db,  domain, :primary => true

namespace :deploy do
  desc "Restart Application"
  task :restart, :roles => :app do
    run "touch #{current_path}/tmp/restart.txt"
  end
end
--------------------------------------------------

[NOTE]
==========================================================================
You may notice that for each deploy, a new spawner server is
created (it'll show up in `passenger-memory-stats`). Indeed, Capistrano will deploy
to a path ending with '/current' (ie : '/var/www/yourapp/current'), so that you don't
have to care about revisions in your virtual host configuration. This '/current' directory
is a symlink to the current revision deployed ('/path_to_app/releases/date_of_the_release').
Therefore, when deploying a new version, the symlink will change, and Phusion Passenger
will think it's a new application, thereby creating a new spawner server:

--------------------------------------------------
1001   30291   [...]   Passenger ApplicationSpawner: /var/www/my_app/releases/20080509104413
1001   31371   [...]   Passenger ApplicationSpawner: /var/www/my_app/releases/20080509104632
--------------------------------------------------

Don't worry about this. The (old) spawner server will terminate itself after its default
timeout (10 minutes), so you will not run out of memory.

If you really want to release the spawner server's memory immediately, then you can add a command
to your Capistrano script to terminate the Passenger spawn server after each deploy. That
command is as follows:

--------------------------------------------------
kill $( passenger-memory-stats | grep 'Passenger spawn server' | awk '{ print $1 }' )
--------------------------------------------------

Killing the spawn server is completely safe, because Phusion Passenger will restart the
spawn server if it has been terminated.
==========================================================================

=== Moving Phusion Passenger to a different directory ===

It is possible to relocate the Phusion Passenger files to a different directory. It
involves two steps:

1. Moving the directory.
2. Updating the ``PassengerRoot'' configuration option in Apache.

For example, if Phusion Passenger is located in '/opt/passenger/', and you'd like to
move it to '/usr/local/passenger/', then do this:

1. Run the following command:
+
------------------------------------
mv /opt/passenger /usr/local/passenger
------------------------------------
2. Edit your Apache configuration file, and set:
+
------------------------------------
PassengerRoot /usr/local/passenger
------------------------------------

=== Installing multiple Ruby on Rails versions ===

Each Ruby on Rails applications that are going to be deployed may require a
specific Ruby on Rails version. You can install a specific version with
this command:
-----------------------------
gem install rails -v X.X.X
-----------------------------
where 'X.X.X' is the version number of Ruby on Rails.

All of these versions will exist in parallel, and will not conflict with each
other. Phusion Passenger will automatically make use of the correct version.

=== X-Sendfile support ===

Phusion Passenger does not provide X-Sendfile support by itself. Please install
link:http://tn123.ath.cx/mod_xsendfile/[mod_xsendfile] for X-Sendfile support.

=== Upload progress ===

Phusion Passenger does not provide upload progress support by itself. Please
try drogus's link:http://github.com/drogus/apache-upload-progress-module/tree/master[
Apache upload progress module] instead.

=== Generic troubleshooting tips

One of the first things you should do upon encountering a problem, is to check
ifdef::apache[]
the *global* (not the per-vhost) Apache error log file. This is typically located in /var/log/apache2/error_log. You can find out the exact location of the error log by running `passenger-config --detect-apache2`.
endif::[]
ifdef::nginx[]
the global Nginx error log file. This is one specified by the `error_log` directive in the main context (*not* the one inside the `http` context). The file is typically located in /var/log/nginx/error.log.
endif::[]
ifdef::standalone[]
Phusion Passenger Standalone log file. This is typically located in `log/passenger.[PORT NUMBER].log`.
endif::[]
Most problems are logged to this file.

ifndef::standalone[]
If you're using Ruby on Rails, then you should be aware that Phusion Passenger runs your app under the 'production' environment by default, not 'development'. You can change this using the
ifdef::apache[]
<<RailsEnv,RailsEnv>>
endif::[]
ifdef::nginx[]
<<RailsEnv,rails_env>>
endif::[]
option.
endif::[]

=== Why does the first request take a long time?

**Symptoms**::
	The first request to your application takes more time than usual. Subsequent requests have the normal speed.

**Cause**::
	Phusion Passenger starts your application the first time it is accessed, not during web server startup. Some applications can take several seconds to start. If you're using Ruby on Rails, then needing 10 seconds to start your application is normal. On slow or heavily loaded servers, or in case of large and heavy applications, the startup time may be even longer.

**Solution**::
	Use the
ifdef::nginx[]
<<PassengerPreStart,passenger_pre_start>>
endif::[]
ifdef::apache[]
<<PassengerPreStart,PassengerPreStart>>
endif::[]
configuration option.

=== Upon accessing the web app, Nginx reports a "Permission denied" error

**Symptoms**::
	A typical error message looks like this:
+
---------------------------------------------
2013/10/21 17:16:03 [alert] 98687#0: *1 Cannot stat
'/Users/phusion/Sites/rack.test/config.ru': Permission denied (errno=13); This
error means that the Nginx worker process (PID 99064, running as UID 70) does
not have permission to access this file. Please read the manual to learn how to
fix this problem: section 'Troubleshooting' -> 'Upon accessing the web app,
Nginx reports a "Permission denied" error'; Extra info, client: 127.0.0.1,
server: www.foo.com, request: "GET / HTTP/1.1", host: "www.foo.com"
---------------------------------------------

**Cause**::
	Phusion Passenger tries to access your application directory in order to find out what language it's written in. This access is initiated from inside an Nginx worker process. This error indicates that the Nginx worker process does not have the proper permissions to access your application's root directory.

**Solution**::
	You need to relax permissions to that the Nginx worker process can access your application directory, by making the directory group- and world-*executable*:
+
---------------------------------------------------
sudo chmod g+x,o+x /Users/phusion/Sites/rack.test
---------------------------------------------------
+
You *also* need to ensure that all parent directories are also 'executable' by the Nginx process:
+
---------------------------------------------------
sudo chmod g+x,o+x /Users/phusion/Sites
sudo chmod g+x,o+x /Users/phusion
sudo chmod g+x,o+x /Users
---------------------------------------------------
+
.Why 'executable' permission and not 'readable'?
[NOTE]
On Unix, the 'executable' permission on directories dictates whether a process is allowed to *access* files or subdirectories within that directory. The 'readable' permission dictates whether a process is allowed to see what files are inside the directory, but does not necessarily allow access to them. You can learn more at link:http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File_system_permissions#Permissions[Wikipedia].

=== Upon uploading a file, Phusion Passenger reports "client_body_temp/00000000xx failed (2: No such file or directory)"

**Symptoms**::
	When performing an HTTP POST call, the request sometimes fails, with Phusion Passenger reporting an error along the lines of:
+
-------------------------
/tmp/passenger-standalone.8583/client_body_temp/0000000022" failed (2: No such
file or directory), client: 127.0.0.1, server: www.foo.com
-------------------------

**Cause**::
	Phusion Passenger buffers HTTP POST bodies (file uploads) to a temporary directory, by default `/tmp/passenger-standalone.xxx`. This error means that Phusion Passenger that that directory has been removed, probably by some other program.

**Solution**::
	Tell Phusion Passenger to use a different directory to store its temporary files passing the `--temp-dir` command line option. For example:
+
---------------------------------------
mkdir $HOME/tmp
cd /path-to-your-app
passenger start --temp-dir=$HOME/tmp
---------------------------------------
endif::[]

Phusion Passenger provides a set of tools, which are useful for system analysis,
maintenance and troubleshooting.


=== Inspecting memory usage ===

Process inspection tools such as `ps` and `top` are useful, but they
link:http://groups.google.com/group/phusion-passenger/msg/1fd1c233456d3180[rarely show the correct memory usage].
The real memory usage is usually lower than what `ps` and `top` report.

There are many technical reasons why this is so, but an explanation is beyond
the scope of this Users Guide. We kindly refer the interested reader to
operating systems literature about 'virtual memory' and 'copy-on-write'.

The tool `passenger-memory-stats` allows one to easily analyze Phusion Passenger's
and the web server's real memory usage. For example:

-------------------------------------------------------
[bash@localhost root]# passenger-memory-stats
------------- Apache processes --------------.
PID    PPID  Threads  VMSize   Private  Name
---------------------------------------------.
5947   1     9        90.6 MB  0.5 MB   /usr/sbin/apache2 -k start
5948   5947  1        18.9 MB  0.7 MB   /usr/sbin/fcgi-pm -k start
6029   5947  1        42.7 MB  0.5 MB   /usr/sbin/apache2 -k start
6030   5947  1        42.7 MB  0.5 MB   /usr/sbin/apache2 -k start
6031   5947  1        42.5 MB  0.3 MB   /usr/sbin/apache2 -k start
6033   5947  1        42.5 MB  0.4 MB   /usr/sbin/apache2 -k start
6034   5947  1        50.5 MB  0.4 MB   /usr/sbin/apache2 -k start
23482  5947  1        82.6 MB  0.4 MB   /usr/sbin/apache2 -k start
### Processes: 8
### Total private dirty RSS: 3.50 MB

----------- Nginx processes ------------.
PID    PPID   VMSize     Resident  Name
----------------------------------------.
51766  51764  82.7 MB    3.9 MB    nginx: master process ./objs/nginx
51773  51766  82.9 MB    0.9 MB    nginx: worker process

--------- Passenger processes ---------.
PID    Threads  VMSize   Private  Name
---------------------------------------.
6026   1        10.9 MB  4.7 MB   Passenger spawn server
23481  1        26.7 MB  3.0 MB   Passenger FrameworkSpawner: 2.0.2
23791  1        26.8 MB  2.9 MB   Passenger ApplicationSpawner: /var/www/projects/app1-foobar
23793  1        26.9 MB  17.1 MB  Rails: /var/www/projects/app1-foobar
### Processes: 4
### Total private dirty RSS: 27.76 M
-------------------------------------------------------

The 'Private' or 'private dirty RSS' field shows the *real* memory usage of processes. Here,
we see that all the Apache and Nginx worker processes only take less than 1 MB memory each.
This is a lot less than the 50-80 MB-ish memory usage as shown in the 'VMSize' column
(which is what a lot of people think is the real memory usage, but is actually not).

NOTE: Private dirty RSS reporting only works on Linux. Unfortunately other operating systems
don't provide facilities for determining processes' private dirty RSS. On non-Linux systems,
the Resident Set Size is reported instead.


=== Inspecting Phusion Passenger's internal status ===

One can inspect Phusion Passenger's internal status with the tool `passenger-status`.
This tool must typically be run as root. For example:

--------------------------------------------------
[bash@localhost root]# passenger-status
----------- General information -----------
max      = 6
count    = 1
active   = 0
inactive = 1

----------- Domains -----------
/var/www/projects/app1-foobar: 
  PID: 9617      Sessions: 0    Processed: 7       Uptime: 2m 23s
--------------------------------------------------

The 'general information' section shows the following information:

max:: The maximum number of application instances that Phusion Passenger will
spawn. This equals the value given for <<PassengerMaxPoolSize,PassengerMaxPoolSize>> (Apache)
or <<PassengerMaxPoolSize,passenger_max_pool_size>> (Nginx).
count:: The number of application instances that are currently alive. This value
is always less than or equal to 'max'.
active:: The number of application instances that are currently processing
requests. This value is always less than or equal to 'count'.
inactive:: The number of application instances that are currently *not* processing
requests, i.e. are idle. Idle application instances will be shutdown after a while,
as can be specified with <<PassengerPoolIdleTime,PassengerPoolIdleTime (Apache)>>/<<PassengerPoolIdleTime,passenger_pool_idle_time (Nginx)>> (unless this
value is set to 0, in which case application instances are never shut down via idle
time). The value of 'inactive' equals `count - active`.

The 'domains' section shows, for each application directory, information about running
application instances:

Sessions:: Shows how many HTTP client are currently in the queue of that application
Instance, waiting to be processed.
Processed:: Indicates how many requests the instance has served until now. *Tip:* it's
possible to limit this number with the <<PassengerMaxRequests,PassengerMaxRequests>>
configuration directive.
Uptime:: Shows for how long the application instance has been running.

Since Phusion Passenger uses fair load balancing by default, the number of sessions for the
application instances should be fairly close to each other. For example, this is fairly
normal:
--------------------------------
  PID: 4281      Sessions: 2      Processed: 7      Uptime: 5m 11s
  PID: 4268      Sessions: 0      Processed: 5      Uptime: 4m 52s
  PID: 4265      Sessions: 1      Processed: 6      Uptime: 5m 38s
  PID: 4275      Sessions: 1      Processed: 7      Uptime: 3m 14s
--------------------------------

But if you see a "spike", i.e. an application instance has an unusually high number of
sessions compared to the others, then there might be a problem:
--------------------------------
  PID: 4281      Sessions: 2      Processed: 7      Uptime: 5m 11s
  PID: 17468     Sessions: 8 <-+  Processed: 2      Uptime: 4m 47s
  PID: 4265      Sessions: 1   |  Processed: 6      Uptime: 5m 38s
  PID: 4275      Sessions: 1   |  Processed: 7      Uptime: 3m 14s
                               |
                               +---- "spike"
--------------------------------

The most likely reason why a spike occurs is because your application is frozen, i.e. it has stopped responding. See <<debugging_frozen,Debugging frozen applications>> for tips.


[[debugging_frozen]]
=== Debugging frozen applications ===

If one of your application processes is frozen (stopped responding), then you
can figure out where it is frozen by killing it with 'SIGABRT'. This will cause the
processs to print a backtrace, after which it aborts. The backtrace information is
logged into the web server error log file.

In case of Ruby applications, you can also send the 'SIGQUIT' signal to have it print
a backtrace without aborting.


=== Accessing individual application processes ===

When a request is sent to the web server, Phusion Passenger will automatically forward
the request to the most suitable application process, but sometimes it is desirable to
be able to directly access the individual application processes. Use cases include, but
are not limited to:

* One wants to debug a memory leak or memory bloat problem that only seems to appear on
  certain URIs. One can send a request to a specific process to see whether that request
  causes the process's memory usage to rise.
* The application caches data in local memory, and one wants to tell a specific
  application process to clear that local data.
* Other debugging use cases.

All individual application processes are accessible via HTTP, so you can use standard
HTTP tools like 'curl'. The exact addresses can be obtained with the command
`passenger-status --verbose`. These sockets are all bound to 127.0.0.1, but the port
number is dynamically assigned. As a security measure, the sockets are also protected
with a process-specific random password, which you can see in the
`passenger-status --verbose` output. This password must be sent through the
``X-Passenger-Connect-Password'' HTTP header.

Example:

[listing]
......................................
bash# passenger-status --verbose
----------- General information -----------
max      = 6
count    = 2
active   = 0
inactive = 2
Waiting on global queue: 0

----------- Application groups -----------
/Users/hongli/Sites/rack.test:
  App root: /Users/hongli/Sites/rack.test
  * PID: 24235   Sessions: 0    Processed: 7       Uptime: 17s
      URL     : http://127.0.0.1:58122
      Password: nFfVOX1F8LjZ90HJh28Sd_htJOsgRsNne2QXKf8NIXw
  * PID: 24250   Sessions: 0    Processed: 4       Uptime: 1s
      URL     : http://127.0.0.1:57933
      Password: _RGXlQ9EGDGJKLevQ_qflUtF1KmxEo2UiRzMwIE1sBY
......................................

Here we see that the web application 'rack.test' has two processes.
Process 24235 is accessible via http://127.0.0.1:58122, and
process 24250 is accessible via http://127.0.0.1:57933.

To access 24235 we must send its password, 'nFfVOX1F8LjZ90HJh28Sd_htJOsgRsNne2QXKf8NIXw',
through the 'X-Passenger-Connect-Password' HTTP header, like this:

-------------------------------------------
bash# curl -H "X-Passenger-Connect-Password: nFfVOX1F8LjZ90HJh28Sd_htJOsgRsNne2QXKf8NIXw" http://127.0.0.1:58122/
-------------------------------------------

=== Attaching an IRB console to an application process ===
:version: 3.0.0
include::enterprise_only.txt[]

You can attach an IRB console to any application process and inspect its state by executing arbitrary Ruby code. Do this by invoking `passenger-irb <PID>` where '<PID>' is the PID of the application process you wish to inspect. Note that the IRB console is currently only available for Ruby apps, not for apps in any other languages.
